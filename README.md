# UrlLib

UrlLib is a cross-platform C++ library that utilizes platform-specific implementations
for URL-related functionality. Although it was created as a subcomponent of
[JsRuntimeHost](https://github.com/BabylonJS/JsRuntimeHost) for its polyfills, it may also be used standalone.

## Error reporting

A request that fails at the transport layer (DNS failure, connection refused, TLS failure,
missing local file, ...) completes with a `StatusCode()` of 0. To make those failures
diagnosable from logs and crash reports, `UrlRequest` additionally exposes:

* `ErrorString()` — the full normalized error, shaped for log-pipeline filtering:
  `"<domain>:<symbol>(<code>): <detail>"`
* `ErrorSymbol()` — the stable symbolic token alone (e.g. `CURLE_COULDNT_RESOLVE_HOST`,
  `NSURLErrorTimedOut`)
* `ErrorCode()` — the raw numeric platform code (CURLcode, NSError code, ...)

`ErrorString()` and `ErrorSymbol()` are empty (and `ErrorCode()` is 0) when the request did
not fail at the transport layer; an HTTP error status such as 404 is **not** a transport
failure. To detect a transport failure, test whether `ErrorString()` (or `ErrorSymbol()`) is
non-empty rather than checking `ErrorCode() != 0`: a genuine failure can carry a zero code
(for example, a missing `app:///` resource reports `AppResourceNotFound` with code `0`).

Examples:

```
curl:CURLE_COULDNT_CONNECT(7): Failed to connect to 127.0.0.1 port 47651 after 0 ms: Couldn't connect to server
curl:CURLE_FILE_COULDNT_READ_FILE(37): Couldn't open file /tmp/missing.bin
nsurl:NSURLErrorCannotConnectToHost(-1004): Could not connect to the server.
nsurl:NSURLErrorServerCertificateUntrusted(-1202): The certificate for this server is invalid. ...
urllib:AppResourceNotFound(0): no bundled resource for 'app:///missing.js'
```

On Apple platforms, when the `NSError` carries an underlying-error chain with different
codes (e.g. a POSIX-level failure), each distinct level is appended as
`<- <domain>(<code>): <message>`.

The `<domain>` and `<symbol>` tokens are stable ASCII identifiers, so observability
queries can filter on exact substrings (e.g. Splunk `"curl:CURLE_COULDNT_RESOLVE_HOST"`
or `"nsurl:NSURLErrorTimedOut"`). The `<detail>` portion is the platform's human-readable
message — it may be OS-localized on Apple platforms and includes request specifics like
host, port, and path where the platform provides them.

Platform support: the Apple (`NSURLSession`) and Linux (`libcurl`) backends populate
these accessors today; the Windows and Android backends currently always report
empty/zero (contributions welcome — the plumbing in `UrlRequest_Base.h` is shared).

## HTTP versions

`UrlRequest` opts each backend into the newest HTTP version the platform stack supports,
negotiating downward automatically — application code never has to care, and plain
`http://` / `file://` requests are unaffected.

| Platform | Backend | HTTP/2 | HTTP/3 (QUIC) |
|---|---|---|---|
| macOS / iOS | `NSURLSession` | automatic (ALPN) since macOS 10.11 / iOS 9 | attempted per request via `assumesHTTP3Capable` on macOS 11.3+ / iOS 14.5+; races QUIC vs TCP with fallback |
| Linux | libcurl | `CURL_HTTP_VERSION_2TLS` when the runtime curl has nghttp2 (all mainstream distros) | `CURL_HTTP_VERSION_3` (with fallback) when the runtime curl ≥ 8.0 reports `CURL_VERSION_HTTP3` (e.g. Fedora today; other distros as they enable it) |
| Windows (Win32 + UWP) | `Windows.Web.Http` | `HttpBaseProtocolFilter.MaxVersion = Http20`, negotiated via ALPN; requires Windows 10 1607+ | not exposed by `Windows.Web.Http` (`HttpVersion` caps at `Http20`); planned via a WinHTTP-based backend, which no-ops the h3 flag before Windows 11 and negotiates down |
| Android | `java.net.HttpURLConnection` | not supported by the platform stack (HTTP/1.1 only) | planned via embedded Cronet (h2 + h3 + Brotli); Quest 1 (Android 10) and Pico 4 (Android 10) clear Cronet's Android 8 minimum |

The Linux detection is at runtime, so the same binary lights up h3 when the system curl
gains it. No UrlLib build options are required.
